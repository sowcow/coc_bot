# this stuff

Currently a part of a bot for one game.
Very nice and readable piece of ruby.

## what it does

Currently it can buy you troops.

## what about farming?

It is being rewritten.
Anyway I'm not automating it 100%, although it is possible.

## depends

- rvm
- jruby (any with ruby 2.0 mode included)
- sikuli (sikuli-script.jar, right path to it in sikuli.rb)
- maxitest a little

## usage

Well, you need to have your own `coc/` directory with `.png` and `.yml` files with named patterns and coordinates to use it...
Create an issue if you need examples.
